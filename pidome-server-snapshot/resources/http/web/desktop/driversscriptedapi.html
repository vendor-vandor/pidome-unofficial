                                <p>Your script has a couple of globally defined variables provided. These are reserved and should not be overridden. These globals help you to debug, log and have 
                                direct access to the driver functionalities, like sending data to your hardware and perform device discovery functionalities.</p>
                                <h4>Defined globals</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>LOG: For logging purposes</li>
                                    <li>DEBUG: for debugging purposes</li>
                                    <li>driver: Access to driver specific functions</li>
                                </ul>
                                <strong>Do not use any global variable for any other purpose then stated otherwise it is lost! Especially for the driver global this is VERY important, without this, your script is useless.</strong>
                                <h4>LOG</h4>
                                <p>The log variable gives you access to the server wide log file (in the future replaced with driver specific log files) where you are able to log your driver events</p>
                                <p>This log variabel has five log levels, info, warn, error, debug and trace.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><kbd>LOG.info(String message)</kbd><br/>Use this to log only informative messages.</li>

                                    <li><kbd>LOG.error(String message)</kbd><br/>Use this to log errors which occur in your script, look ahead for an example.</li>
                                    <li><kbd>LOG.debug(String message)</kbd><br/>Use this to log debug messages which can help you identify issues when these arise. When the server has debug mode enabled these message will appear in the log file. This is not part of the debug output on this page!</li>
                                    <li><kbd>LOG.trace(String message)</kbd><br/>Use this to log tracing of your script flow. This is only used in extreme cases where you would be needing a lot if information. To see these message in the log file the server has to be started in trace mode.</li>

                                <p><kbd>driver</kbd> is a special variable which gives you access to a basic default driver's functions. By default drivers do not inherrit any discovery features
                                but this has been added to the scripting.</p>
                                <p>the driver aPI is explain at the Driver section and there is an additional section added so you are able to implement device discovery features if needed.</p>

                                <h3>Devices</h3>
                                <p>Devices are the entities in the server you will be serving data from by pressing a button or using an other control in the web interface, clients or JSON-RPC API. 
                                    This section of the API explains how to update control's values and how to intepret requests being made by a device's control.</p>
                                <h3>Device structure</h3>
                                <p>A device is made up of different components. It has a name, description, a group of controls, the controls inside groups,options and an address. All these properties are
                                    available to you in this script. A very abstract model of a device is like this with some important parts mentioned:</p>
                                <pre><code class="javascript">
{ 
    device { 
        name: "device name",
        description: "A device description" 
        controlgroups: [{
            id:"groupid",
            controls: [{
                id:"controlid",
                otherparameters:othervalues
            }]
        }],
        options: [{
            id: "optionid1",
            type: "input"
        },{
            id: "optionid2",
            type: "select",
            options: [{
                id: "optionid",
                label: "option visual"
            }]
        }],
        address: {
            label: "quick description",
            description: "A larger description about the address"
        }
    }
}
                                </code></pre>
                                <p>The above should give a small idea on how a device has been set up so you will understand the some important parts of the API. You will not be working with any
                                JSON code but there are convenience functions available which will enable you to retreive the above.</p>
                                <p>The part you will mostly work with are device groups and controls, If you are planning to create a network of devices the address will also be important for you</p>
                                <h3>The device API</h3>
                                <p>the below api refers to the device variable which is not a global variable but available inside the function <kbd>var handleDeviceData = function(device, request){}</kbd>. where device is the parameter supplied.</p>
                                <p>You can always retrieve devices from the functions called by the server and for this you need the special driver global variable. Refer to the Driver API on how to retreive a device.</p>
                                <h4>Device information</h4>
                                <p>When working with devices it sometimes comes in handy to have a device name, id or description in a log file</p>

                                <h3>Driver</h3>
                                <p>In scripts you have access to a global variable called <kbd>driver</kbd>. This global variable holds all the needed functionalities to be able
                                to receive data from the hardware, send data to the hardware and find out which devices are currently actively running</p>
                                <p>There is much more available in the <kbd>driver</kbd> variable but because a lot of these functions are not marked final yet they will not be 
                                   handled in the API until they are. These functions make it possible to delete,create and modify devices on the fly, enable discovery (See discovery API)
                                   and utility functions to manipulate data</p>
                                <p>For now the API only described the basics.</p>

                                <h4>the driver mechanism</h4>
                                <p>Your scripted drivers can be reloaded in real time and they are part of the bigger driver picture. Normally a driver is completely unloaded from memory
                                    when it is being restarted. Scripted drivers are not! The only part that is reloaded is your script, not the whole driver mechanism.</p>
                                <p>When drivers are restarted the connection is closed with the hardware and all devices are unloaded. When they start again connections with the hardware
                                    is re-opened and devices are re-loaded into memory</p>
                                <p>With scripted drivers everything stays is in memory but only your code is unloaded and reloaded again. Keep this in mind. This means you have to clean up
                                    after yourself! See the <kbd>driverStop</kbd> function for details.</p>

                                <h4>Ready and stopping signals</h4>
                                <p>These functions are needed to let you know when the driver starts and when it stops.</p>
                                <h5>Ready</h5>
                                <p>As it takes time to load drivers, and especially scripted drivers you need some sort of signal to know when you can start handling data from 
                                    and be able to send data to hardware.</p>
                                <p>To overcome this you need to implement a <kbd>driverStart</kbd> function. This function is called by the server to let you know your script has been
                                    loaded and is ready to do it's magic</p>

                                   saving and restarting your script. To let you know that your scripted driver is going to stopped the server sends a stop signal to your script so
                                   you can let your hardware know it is bye bye.</p>
                                <p>It is required to have a stop function in your code called <kbd>driverStop</kbd> This function is called by the server to let you know your script is
