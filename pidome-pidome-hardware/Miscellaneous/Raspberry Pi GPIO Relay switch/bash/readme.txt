These scripts are only needed if you want to test out the relay-switch outside of de PiDome environment, ie. testing.

on.sh -> Turns on the relay using pin 25
off.sh -> Turns off the relay using pin 25
cleanup.sh -> Clears the GPIO settings for pin 25

NOTE: These scripts use GPIO pin 25, adjust it to the port if you're using some other port!
