# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for the PiDome JavaFX desktop/Mobile/Embedded client from a single code base.

### How do I get set up? ###

Information about the client can be found here: http://pidome.org/info/blog-news/2015/8/27/glued-the-interfaces-together-alpha-version-downloads-available.html

We will try to create a good readme as soon as possible

There are currently three downloads on the download page:

Desktop client which runs on Windows and Mac. Please install Java 8 first.
Android client. No special actions needed.
Raspberry Pi Client. No special actions needed as this is a special bundled package.

If you got any questions ask these on http://forum.pidome.org
